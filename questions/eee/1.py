"""
Given two strings, write a function to determine if they are anagrams.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:
Input: "listen", "silent"
Output: True
Explanation: "listen" and "silent" contain the same letters, just in a different order.

Example 2:
Input: "hello", "world"
Output: False
Explanation: These strings contain different letters.

Example 3:
Input: "anagram", "nagaram"
Output: True
Explanation: "anagram" and "nagaram" contain the same letters in a different order.

Example 4:
Input: "rat", "car"
Output: False
Explanation: These strings contain different letters.

Write a function is_anagram(str1, str2) that takes two strings as input and returns True if they are anagrams, and False otherwise.

Note:
- The function should be case-sensitive.
- Spaces and punctuation should be considered in the anagram check.
- An empty string is only an anagram of another empty string.
- The strings can be of different lengths, but they must contain the exact same characters to be anagrams.
