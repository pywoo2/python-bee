"""
Given a non-negative integer n, write a function to calculate its factorial.

The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 120
Explanation: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

Example 2:
Input: 0
Output: 1
Explanation: The factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.

Example 3:
Input: 10
Output: 3628800
Explanation: 10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 3628800

Write a function calculate_factorial(n) that takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns its factorial.

Note:
- The input n will always be a non-negative integer.
- The function should handle large factorials efficiently.
- Consider using recursion or iteration to solve this problem.
- Be aware of potential integer overflow for large inputs.
