"""
Given a string, write a function to determine if it is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

Example 1:
Input: "A man a plan a canal Panama"
Output: True
Explanation: Ignoring spaces and capitalization, it reads the same forward and backward.

Example 2:
Input: "race a car"
Output: False
Explanation: This is not a palindrome when ignoring spaces.

Example 3:
Input: "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"
Output: True
Explanation: Ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization, it's a palindrome.

Write a function is_palindrome(s) that takes a string as input and returns True if it's a palindrome, and False otherwise.

Note:
- The function should ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when checking for palindromes.
- An empty string should be considered a palindrome.
- The input string may contain alphanumeric characters, spaces, and punctuation marks.
