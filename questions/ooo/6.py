"""
Given a list of numbers, write a function that returns the sum of all numbers in the list.

Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 15

Write a function sum_numbers(numbers) that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all numbers in the list.

Note:
- The list may contain both integers and floating-point numbers.
- If the list is empty, the function should return 0.
- You can assume that all elements in the list are valid numbers.
