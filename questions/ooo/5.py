"""
Given a string, write a function that returns the reverse of the string.

Example:
Input: "Hello, World!"
Output: "!dlroW ,olleH"

Write a function reverse_string(s) that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.

Note:
- The function should preserve the original case of the characters.
- Special characters and spaces should be included in the reversed string.
- An empty string should return an empty string.
