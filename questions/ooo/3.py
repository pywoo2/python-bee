"""
Given a string, write a function that returns the string with all vowels removed.

Example:
Input: "Hello, World!"
Output: "Hll, Wrld!"

Write a function remove_vowels(s) that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) removed.

Note: For this problem, consider 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' as vowels.
